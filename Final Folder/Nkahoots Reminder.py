# Program: N'Kahoots Beauty Bot
# Date: July 25,2023
# Programmer: Chantey Chasteen
# Description: This program is a skincare guide that helps users identify their skin type and provides personalized
#              skincare routines and product recommendations based on the skin type selected. Users can select their
#              skin type from the available options (Dry, Oily, Combination, Sensitive) and view recommended skincare
#              products and a daily skincare schedule. Additionally, users have the option to set a daily reminder
#              for their skincare routine.
#
# Features:
# - GUI created using Python's tkinter library
# - Displays instructions on how to pick the correct skin type
# - Allows users to select their skin type from buttons and view descriptions for each skin type
# - Shows recommended products and a skincare schedule for the selected skin type
# - Provides a "Set Daily Reminder" feature to set a daily notification for the skincare routine
# - Saves the application date and time to a CSV file
#
# Programming Details:
# - The code is divided into functions to improve modularity and readability.
# - Constants are used to store paths and fixed values for easier maintenance.
# - Error handling is implemented to handle invalid inputs and exceptions gracefully.
# - The program uses Python dictionaries to store data for each skin type (skin_data) and best times to wash face (best_times).
# - The GUI components (labels, buttons, etc.) are created and arranged using the tkinter library.
# - Images are displayed using the PIL library (Python Imaging Library).
# - Regular expressions (re module) are used for input validation.
# - The program employs object-oriented programming principles to organize related functionalities.
